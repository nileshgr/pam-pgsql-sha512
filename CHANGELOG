pam-pgsql (0.5.2-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Marking the removal of the ("pgpkeys") from my Comment field in the gpg
    key. Since the original secret key was lost in a crash I changed the key
    and the Commet field.

  * Added a sub-dir called public_key/ which contains both the OLD public key
    and the NEW public key. The OLD key was signed with the NEW key in order
    to establish within the package that a key changeover had taken place.
    Since there was no way to revoke the key publicly, all documentation
    regarding the lost key discussion can be found in the
    debian-devel@lists.debian.org mail list archives. NOTE: This is _not_
    meant to _supplant_ the established Debian rules regarding keys, but
    merely to _augment_ that policy.

  * Also imported entire structure from pristine source through current
    version into CVS. I felt it was time to start using cvs-buildpackage to
    handle package maintenence. HEAVY thanks go out to michaelw@debian.org for
    helping me with getting the cvs up and running and teaching me the basics
    correctly of cvs-buildpackage. (gotta love cvs-inject *.dsc)

  * Fixed typo in README for pwtype. Thanks Tobias Olsson <tobias@toface.linux-site.net>
    and Robert Pintarelli <robert.pintarelli@wh-hms.uni-ulm.de>. Closes: #138602, #142849

  * Bad code for the queries was causing the system to lock out _every_ user
    on the box if any single account was expired. Not Good(Tm). The fix for
    this was submitted by Robert Pintarelli <robert.pintarelli@wh-hms.uni-ulm.de>
    Closes: #143745
